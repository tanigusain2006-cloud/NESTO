NESTO – Neurodiverse Education Support Tool

NESTO is a concept-stage, sensory-friendly, activity-based learning support platform designed for children aged 5–8, with a focus on neurodivergent learners, including children on the Autism Spectrum (ASD).
It is intentionally non-medical, non-diagnostic, and non-therapeutic, and focuses on calm, predictable visual activities that feel like play—not tests, games, or therapy.

🌱 Design Philosophy

NESTO is built as a safe digital playground:

Visually simple and uncluttered

Sensory-friendly and predictable

No pressure, no performance tracking

One task at a time, short and repeatable

The platform avoids adult “elegant” aesthetics and instead prioritizes clarity, accessibility, and comfort, using soft colors, large touch targets, and gentle animations.

🎯 What NESTO Is (and Is Not)
✅ NESTO IS

An activity-based support platform

Designed with therapist-informed, sensory-friendly principles

Focused on micro-skills like matching, tracing, sequencing, and recognition

Offline-friendly and privacy-first

❌ NESTO IS NOT

A medical or therapeutic tool

A diagnostic or assessment system

A school curriculum or exam platform

A gamified, reward-driven app

A data-tracking or profiling product

🧩 Activities

All activities follow the same rules:

One activity per screen

4–5 short rounds per session

No repetition of rounds

Automatic, smooth transitions between rounds

No scores, timers, sounds, levels, or rewards

1. Match Food by Colour

Children drag colored food items to children wearing matching colored clothes.
Examples: red apple → red shirt, blue berries → blue shirt, yellow banana → yellow shirt, green grapes → green shirt, orange carrot → orange shirt.

2. Find the Path

Children trace wide, forgiving paths from a start point to an end point using slow finger movement.
Examples: straight path, curved path, zigzag path, spiral path, winding path.

3. Connect the Dots

Children connect large, well-spaced dots in order to form simple geometric shapes suitable for ages 5–8.
Examples: square, rectangle, triangle, hexagon, simple rounded star.

4. Colour by Number

Children select a numbered color and tap matching numbered areas in a simple picture; the number disappears and color fills the area.
Examples: house (roof, walls, door), tree (leaves, trunk), car (body, wheels), flower (petals, stem), balloon (balloon, string).

5. Match the Alphabet (Letters in Bubbles)

Children drag translucent letter bubbles together so matching letters merge.
Examples: A–A, B–B, D–D, L–L, M–M.

6. Flash Cards – Foods & Vegetables

Children swipe through large images with names for calm recognition.
Examples: apple, carrot, banana, potato, mango, onion, grapes, peas.

👨‍👩‍👧 Parent Dashboard

The Parent Dashboard is a reflection space, not an analytics panel.

It shows:

Activities explored

Activities revisited

Activities that took more time

It does not show:

Scores or percentages

Accuracy or rankings

Behavioral labels or diagnoses

One optional real-world activity suggestion is included to support gentle transfer outside the screen.

🏫 Schools & NGOs

NESTO is designed for:

Schools

NGOs

Inclusive classrooms

Community learning centers

It is offline-first, easy to deploy on shared devices, and free from child monitoring or profiling.
Sustainability is intended through institutional licensing, CSR funding, or grants, not ads or child data.

🔐 Privacy & Data Safety

No user accounts

No personal information collected

No camera, microphone, or sensors

No analytics or tracking

Data stored locally on the device only

Privacy is protected by design, not by policy.

🛠️ Technology (Prototype)

Frontend-only implementation

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Local storage for session summaries

No backend, no database, no cloud sync

🚧 Project Status

NESTO is currently a working prototype / concept model created to demonstrate:

Ethical product design

Sensory-friendly UX

Feasibility for real-world use

It is not a finished commercial product.

🧭 Ethical Note

NESTO respects neurodiversity.
It does not frame differences as deficits or “superpowers,” but as valid ways of experiencing and interacting with the world that deserve thoughtful design.

📌 Final Statement

NESTO supports calm interaction and independence by removing pressure, not by measuring performance.
